```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
library(quantmod)
options(getSymbols.warning4.0 = FALSE)
```

You can plot error bars (or any other high/low oriented data) along with a series by simply specifying the lower, value, and upper series together in the `dySeries` name parameter. For example:

```{r}
hw <- HoltWinters(ldeaths)
predicted <- predict(hw, n.ahead = 72, prediction.interval = TRUE)
dygraph(predicted, main = "Predicted Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>%
  dySeries(c("lwr", "fit", "upr"), label = "Deaths")
```

Here's another example that plots multiple series each of which have upper and lower bars:

```{r}
library(quantmod)
getSymbols(c("MSFT", "HPQ"), src="rda", from = "2014-06-01")
stocks <- cbind(MSFT[,2:4], HPQ[,2:4])
dygraph(stocks, main = "Microsoft and HP Share Prices") %>% 
  dySeries(c("MSFT.Low", "MSFT.Close", "MSFT.High"), label = "MSFT") %>%
  dySeries(c("HPQ.Low", "HPQ.Close", "HPQ.High"), label = "HPQ")
```
