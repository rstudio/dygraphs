title: "Roll Periods"

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
```


In order to smooth out the display of a series you can specify a `rollPeriod`. This will result in each plotted point representing an average of the number of timestamps specified in the roll period. The roll period will be displayed in a text box at the bottom-left of the plot so that viewers of the plot are aware of the averaging and so that they can change it if they like.

The `dyRoller` function adds a roller with a specified roll period:

```{r}
dygraph(discoveries, main = "Important Discoveries")  %>% 
  dyRoller(rollPeriod = 5)
```
