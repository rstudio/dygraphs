<p>You can add a shading effect to the graph background for one or more time ranges. This is useful for highlighting periods of time with special properties (e.g. holding periods for securities).</p>
<p>For example, the following code adds a shading effect to the 1920’s and 1940’s for the New Haven Temperatures graph:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dygraph(nhtemp, main = &quot;New Haven Temperatures&quot;) %&gt;% 
  dyShading(from = &quot;1920-1-1&quot;, to = &quot;1930-1-1&quot;) %&gt;%
  dyShading(from = &quot;1940-1-1&quot;, to = &quot;1950-1-1&quot;)</code></pre>
