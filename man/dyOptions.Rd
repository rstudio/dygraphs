\arguments{
\item{dygraph}{Dygraph to add options to}

\item{stackedGraph}{If set, stack series on top of one another rather than 
drawing them independently. The first series specified in the input data 
will wind up on top of the chart and the last will be on bottom.}

\item{fillGraph}{Should the area underneath the graph be filled? This option 
is not compatible with error bars. This option can also be set on a 
per-series basis.}

\item{fillAlpha}{Transparency for filled regions of the plot. A value of 0.0 
means that the fill will not be drawn, whereas a value of 1.0 means that 
the fill will be as dark as the line of the series itself.}

\item{stepPlot}{When set, display the graph as a step plot instead of a line 
plot. This option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{stemPlot}{When set, display the graph as a stem plot instead of a line
plot. This option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{drawPoints}{Draw a small dot at each point, in addition to a line going
through the point. This makes the individual data points easier to see, but
can increase visual clutter in the chart. This option can also be set on a 
per-series basis.}

\item{pointSize}{The size of the dot to draw on each point in pixels. A dot 
is always drawn when a point is "isolated", i.e. there is a missing point 
on either side of it. This also controls the size of those dots. This 
option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{pointShape}{The shape of the dot to draw. Can be one of the following:
"dot" (default), "triangle", "square", "diamond", "pentagon", "hexagon",
"circle", "star", "plus" or "ex". This option can also be set on a per-series
basis.}

\item{drawGapEdgePoints}{Draw points at the edges of gaps in the data. This 
improves visibility of small data segments or other data irregularities.}

\item{connectSeparatedPoints}{Usually, when dygraphs encounters a missing 
value in a data series, it interprets this as a gap and draws it as such. 
If, instead, the missing values represents an x-value for which only a 
different series has data, then you'll want to connect the dots by setting 
this to true. To explicitly include a gap with this option set, use a value 
of NaN.}

\item{strokeWidth}{The width of the lines connecting data points. This can be
used to increase the contrast or some graphs. This option can also be set 
on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokePattern}{A custom pattern array where the even index is a draw 
and odd is a space in pixels. If null then it draws a solid line. The array
should have a even length as any odd length array could be expressed as a 
smaller even length array. This is used to create dashed lines. This option
can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokeBorderWidth}{Draw a border around graph lines to make crossing 
lines more easily distinguishable. Useful for graphs with many lines. This 
option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{strokeBorderColor}{Color for the line border used if 
\code{strokeBorderWidth} is set. This option can also be set on a 
per-series basis.}

\item{plotter}{A function (or array of functions) which plot each data series
on the chart. May also be set on a per-series basis. See the 
\href{http://dygraphs.com/tests/plotters.html}{dygraphs documentation} for 
additional details on plotting functions.}

\item{colors}{Character vector of colors for the data series. These can be of
the form "#AABBCC" or "rgb(255,100,200)" or "yellow", etc. If not 
specified, equally-spaced points around a color wheel are used. This option
can also be set on a per-series basis. Note that in both global and 
per-series specification of custom colors you must provide a color for all 
series being displayed. Note also that global and per-series color 
specification cannot be mixed.}

\item{colorValue}{If custom colors are not specified, value of the data 
series colors, as in hue/saturation/value (0.0-1.0, default 0.5).}

\item{colorSaturation}{If custom colors are not specified, saturation of the 
automatically-generated data series colors (0.0-1.0, default 0.5).}

\item{drawXAxis}{Whether to draw the x-axis. Setting this to false also 
prevents x-axis ticks from being drawn and reclaims the space for the chart
grid/lines.}

\item{drawYAxis}{Whether to draw the y-axis. Setting this to false also 
prevents y-axis ticks from being drawn and reclaims the space for the chart
grid/lines.}

\item{includeZero}{Usually, dygraphs will use the range of the data plus some
padding to set the range of the y-axis. If this option is set, the y-axis 
will always include zero, typically as the lowest value. This can be used 
to avoid exaggerating the variance in the data.}

\item{drawAxesAtZero}{When set, draw the X axis at the Y=0 position and the Y
axis at the X=0 position if those positions are inside the graph's visible 
area. Otherwise, draw the axes at the bottom or left graph edge as usual.}

\item{logscale}{When set the graph shows the y-axis in log scale. Any values 
less than or equal to zero are not displayed.}

\item{axisTickSize}{The spacing between axis labels and tick marks.}

\item{axisLineColor}{Color of the x- and y-axis lines. Accepts any value 
which the HTML canvas strokeStyle attribute understands, e.g. 'black' or 
'rgb(0, 100, 255)'. This can also be set on a per-axis basis.}

\item{axisLineWidth}{Thickness (in pixels) of the x- and y-axis lines. This 
can also be set on a per-axis basis.}

\item{axisLabelColor}{Color for x- and y-axis labels. This is a CSS color 
string. This may also be set on a per-axis basis.}

\item{axisLabelFontSize}{Size of the font (in pixels) to use in the axis 
labels, both x- and y-axis. This may also be set on a per-axis basis.}

\item{axisLabelWidth}{Width (in pixels) of the containing divs for x- and 
y-axis labels.}

\item{drawGrid}{Whether to display grid lines in the chart. This may be set 
on a per-axis basis to define the visibility of each axis' grid separately.
Defaults to \code{TRUE} for x and y, and \code{FALSE} for y2.}

\item{gridLineColor}{The color of the grid lines. This option can also be set
on a per-series basis.}

\item{gridLineWidth}{Thickness (in pixels) of the grid lines drawn under the 
chart. This option can also be set on a per-series basis.}

\item{titleHeight}{Height of the chart title, in pixels. This also controls 
the default font size of the title. If you style the title on your own, 
this controls how much space is set aside above the chart for the title's 
div.}

\item{rightGap}{Number of pixels to leave blank at the right edge of the 
Dygraph. This makes it easier to highlight the right-most data point.}

\item{digitsAfterDecimal}{Unless it's run in scientific mode (see the 
\code{sigFigs} option), dygraphs displays numbers with 
\code{digitsAfterDecimal} digits after the decimal point. Trailing zeros 
are not displayed, so with a value of 2 you'll get '0', '0.1', '0.12', 
'123.45' but not '123.456' (it will be rounded to '123.46'). Numbers with 
absolute value less than 0.1^digitsAfterDecimal (i.e. those which would 
show up as '0.00') will be displayed in scientific notation.}

\item{labelsKMB}{Show K/M/B for thousands/millions/billions on y-axis.}

\item{labelsKMG2}{Show k/M/G for kilo/Mega/Giga on y-axis. This is different 
than \code{labelsKMB} in that it uses base 2, not 10.}

\item{labelsUTC}{Show date/time labels according to UTC (instead of local 
time). Note that this option cannot is incompatible with
\code{useDataTimezone} (you must use one or the other).}

\item{maxNumberWidth}{When displaying numbers in normal (not scientific) 
mode, large numbers will be displayed with many trailing zeros (e.g. 
100000000 instead of 1e9). This can lead to unwieldy y-axis labels. If 
there are more than maxNumberWidth digits to the left of the decimal in a 
number, dygraphs will switch to scientific notation, even when not 
operating in scientific mode. If you'd like to see all those digits, set 
this to something large, like 20 or 30.}

\item{sigFigs}{By default, dygraphs displays numbers with a fixed number of 
digits after the decimal point. If you'd prefer to have a fixed number of 
significant figures, set this option to that number of significant figures.
A value of 2, for instance, would cause 1 to be display as 1.0 and 1234 to 
be displayed as 1.23e+3.}

\item{panEdgeFraction}{A value representing the farthest a graph may be 
panned, in percent of the display. For example, a value of 0.1 means that 
the graph can only be panned 10% pased the edges of the displayed values. 
null means no bounds.}

\item{animatedZooms}{Set this option to animate the transition between zoom 
windows. Applies to programmatic and interactive zooms. Note that if you 
also set a drawCallback, it will be called several times on each zoom. If 
you set a zoomCallback, it will only be called after the animation is 
complete.}

\item{mobileDisableYTouch}{Set this option to automatically disable touch
events on the Y axis for mobile devices (since this interferes with 
swiping/scrolling on mobile devices).}

\item{timingName}{Set this option to log timing information. The value of the
option will be logged along with the timing, so that you can distinguish 
multiple dygraphs on the same page.}

\item{useDataTimezone}{Whether to use the time zone of the underlying xts 
object for display. Defaults to \code{FALSE} which uses the time zone of 
the client workstation. Note that this option is incompatible with 
\code{labelsUTC} (you must use one or other other).}

\item{retainDateWindow}{Whether to retain the user's current date window 
(zoom level) when updating an existing dygraph with new data and/or 
options.}

\item{disableZoom}{Set this option to disable click and drag zooming.}
