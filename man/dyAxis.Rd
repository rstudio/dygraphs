}
\arguments{
\item{dygraph}{Dygraph to add an axis definition to}

\item{name}{Axis name ('x', 'y', or 'y2')}

\item{label}{Label to display for axis (defaults to none).}

\item{valueRange}{Explicitly set the vertical range of the graph to 
\code{c(low, high)}. This may be set on a per-axis basis to define each 
y-axis separately. If either limit is unspecified, it will be calculated 
automatically (e.g. \code{c(NULL, 30)} to automatically calculate just the 
lower bound).}

\item{logscale}{When set for the y-axis or x-axis, the graph shows that axis
in log scale. Any values less than or equal to zero are not displayed.
Showing log scale with ranges that go below zero will result in an
unviewable graph. Not compatible with showZero. connectSeparatedPoints is
ignored. This is ignored for date-based x-axes.}

\item{ticker}{This lets you specify an arbitrary JavaScript function to 
generate tick marks on an axis. The tick marks are an array of (value, 
label) pairs. The built-in functions go to great lengths to choose good 
tick marks so, if you set this option, you'll most likely want to call one 
of them and modify the result. See dygraph-tickers.js and the 
\href{http://dygraphs.com/options.html}{dygraphs documentation} for 
additional details).}

\item{rangePad}{Add the specified amount of extra space (in pixels) around 
the value range to ensure points at the edges remain visible.}

\item{labelWidth}{Width of the div which contains the y-axis label. Since the
y-axis label appears rotated 90 degrees, this actually affects the height 
of its div.}

\item{labelHeight}{Height of the x-axis label, in pixels. This also controls 
the default font size of the x-axis label. If you style the label on your 
own, this controls how much space is set aside below the chart for the 
x-axis label's div.}

\item{axisHeight}{Height, in pixels, of the x-axis. If not set explicitly, 
this is computed based on \code{axisLabelFontSize} and \code{axisTickSize}.}

\item{axisLineColor}{Color of the x- and y-axis lines. Accepts any value 
which the HTML canvas strokeStyle attribute understands, e.g. 'black' or 
'rgb(0, 100, 255)'.}

\item{axisLineWidth}{Thickness (in pixels) of the x- and y-axis lines.}

\item{pixelsPerLabel}{Number of pixels to require between each x- and 
y-label. Larger values will yield a sparser axis with fewer ticks. Defaults
to 50 (x-axis) or 30 (y-axes).}

\item{axisLabelColor}{Color for x- and y-axis labels. This is a CSS color 
string. This may also be set globally using \code{dyOptions}.}

\item{axisLabelFontSize}{Size of the font (in pixels) to use in the axis 
labels, both x- and y-axis. This may also be set globally using 
\code{dyOptions}.}

\item{axisLabelWidth}{Width, in pixels, of the axis labels}

\item{axisLabelFormatter}{JavaScript function to call to format the tick 
values that appear along an axis (see the 
\href{http://dygraphs.com/options.html}{dygraphs documentation} for 
additional details).}

\item{valueFormatter}{JavaScript function to call to provide a custom display
format for the values displayed on mouseover (see the 
\href{http://dygraphs.com/options.html}{dygraphs documentation} for 
additional details).}

\item{drawGrid}{Whether to display grid lines in the chart.}

\item{gridLineColor}{The color of the grid lines.}

\item{gridLineWidth}{Thickness (in pixels) of the grid lines drawn under the 
chart.}

\item{independentTicks}{Only valid for y and y2, has no effect on x: This 
option defines whether the y axes should align their ticks or if they 
should be independent. Possible combinations: 1.) y=true, y2=false 
(default): y is the primary axis and the y2 ticks are aligned to the the 
ones of y. (only 1 grid) 2.) y=false, y2=true: y2 is the primary axis and 
the y ticks are aligned to the the ones of y2. (only 1 grid) 3.) y=true, 
y2=true: Both axis are independent and have their own ticks. (2 grids) 4.) 
y=false, y2=false: Invalid configuration causes an error.}

\description{
Define options for an axis on a dygraph plot. Note that options will use the 
default global setting (as determined by \code{\link{dyOptions}}) when not 
specified explicitly.
